This was a weekend homework from CodeClan to develop a Web App using an API.

Learning Objectives :-
Be able to create a web application with a modular front-end
Be able to implement reusable and nested views
Be able to make API requests to load JSON data into your application

I choose to make a web application that called on the XKCD API to either produce a requested comic by number or select a random comic from the current published list.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get the project up and running on your local machine for development purposes.

### Installing

Install dependencies:
```
npm install

Run webpack (leave running in a terminal window):
```
npm run build

Open HTML in Chrome
```
index.html
